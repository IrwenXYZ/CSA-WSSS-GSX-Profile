# CSA WSSS GSX Profile
GSX Pro Profile for CSA's WSSS scenery for MSFS. Very not done, extremely WIP.

This GSX Profile aims to be VATSIM compliant. This means that when you fly out from WSSS, you can fully and effectively comply with the controller's pusback procedures. This includes any push/pull procedures.

Not all pushback procedures might be true to life. If you have any reference for procedures that can be improved to be more real to life, please open an issue!

Gates with Left & Right variants (e.g. D40L, D40R) will not be customised as they are not being used in VATSIM.

## Done
500 bays  
600 bays  
300-306  
D32-D35, D40-D49

## In Progress
Work is being done on a top down basis for the cargo and remote bays north of the terminals, and clockwise basis for the terminals starting from the D gates at Terminal 1. The 400 gates are excluded as they are not present in CSA's WSSS scenery.

Working on: T1 D Gates
