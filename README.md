# CSA WSSS GSX Profile
GSX Pro Profile for CSA's WSSS scenery for MSFS.

## Installation Instructions
1. Ensure Microsoft Flight Simulator and GSX Pro are closed
2. Copy the downloaded files: WSSS-CSA-IrwenXYZ.ini **AND** WSSS-CSA-IrwenXYZ.py
3. Paste it in the GSX Config directory, typically `C:\Users\\AppData\Roaming\virtuali\GSX\MSFS`

## What this profile includes
- Renamed gates according to terminals, cargo aprons, and remote aprons
- VATSIM compliant pushback procedures (based on https://pushback.sinvacc.org)
- Proper bay sizes
- Parking positions
- Custom stop positions (for A310, A320 family, A339, A380, B787, B747, B777)
- Custom vehicle positions
- VDGS

Not all pushback procedures might be true to life. If you have any reference for procedures that can be improved to be more real to life, please open an issue on Github (https://github.com/IrwenXYZ/CSA-WSSS-GSX-Profile/issues)!

## Flying in or out of WSSS? Take note of the following!
WSSS Charts (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1uRYButM_A5nqOUlmm0kG5A0sKPhCam1E)

Please note that there has been major airspace and procedure changes as of AIRAC 2403. If you do not have AIRAC 2403 or after, please inform the controller!

## Notes
- Please enable "Automated reposition" in GSX settings
- F36 will always show up as the first F gate due to GSX limitations
- G1's pushback procedure will not be correct until CSA removes the current construction site there
