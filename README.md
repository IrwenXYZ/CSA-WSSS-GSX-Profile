# CSA WSSS GSX Profile
GSX Pro Profile for CSA's WSSS scenery for MSFS. Very not done, extremely WIP.

## Completed Bays
500 bays  
600 bays  
300-306  
T1 D gates  
T2 gates (E & F)

## Installation Instructions
1. Ensure Microsoft Flight Simulator and GSX Pro are closed
2. Copy the downloaded files: WSSS-CSA-IrwenXYZ.ini **AND** WSSS-CSA-IrwenXYZ.py
3. Paste it in the GSX Config directory, typically `C:\Users\\AppData\Roaming\virtuali\GSX\MSFS`

## What this profile includes
- Renamed gates according to terminals, cargo aprons, and remote aprons
- VATSIM compliant pushback procedures
    - All pushback procedures are based off of SINvACC's pushback procedure website (https://pushback.sinvacc.org/)
    - This includes any push/pull procedures
- Proper bay sizes
- Parking positions
- VDGS
- Custom stop positions (for A310, A320 family, A330, B787, B747)

Not all pushback procedures might be true to life. If you have any reference for procedures that can be improved to be more real to life, please open an issue on Github (https://github.com/IrwenXYZ/CSA-WSSS-GSX-Profile/issues)!

Gates with Left & Right variants (e.g. D40L, D40R) will not be customised for now.

## Flying in or out of WSSS? Take note of the following!

Please note that there has been major airspace and procedure changes as of AIRAC 2403. If you do not have AIRAC 2403 or after, please inform the controller!

## In Progress
Work is being done on a top down basis for the cargo and remote bays north of the terminals, and clockwise basis for the terminals starting from the D gates at Terminal 1. The 400 gates are excluded as they are not present in CSA's WSSS scenery.

## Notes
- F36 will always show up as the first F gate due to GSX limitations
- G gates will show up as 2 sections until a find a fix
- E6 is basically unusable right now, until the developers fix the bridge blocking the VDGS
